# Rcode for Adjusting inverse regression for predictors with clustered distribution
  (12/6/2023ï¼Œsubmitted to Electronic Journal of Statistics)
1. fsir.R: Include all support functions to implement the SIR_M and SIR_RM methods.
2. fsave.R: Include all support functions to implement the SAVE_M and SAVE_RM methods.
3. fssir.R: Include all support functions to implement the SIR_M and SIR_RM methods under the high-dimensional sparse settings.
4. function ADR.R: Include all support functions of ADR (On Aggregate Dimension Reduction, by Wang, Yin, Li and Tang, 2019, Sinica).
5. myCHIME.R: Parameter estimation and clustering for a two-class Gaussian mixture via the EM algorithm. (CHIME: CLUSTERING OF HIGH-   
   DIMENSIONAL GAUSSIAN MIXTURES WITH EM ALGORITHM AND ITS OPTIMALITY, by T. TONY CAI, JING MA AND LINJUN ZHANG, 2019, AOS).       
6. model_SIR.Rmd, model_SAVE.Rmd, model_SSIR.Rmd: some model setting for adjusted SIR (SIR_M and SIR_RM), adjusted SAVE (SAVE_M and SAVE_RM), adjusted high-dimensional sparse SIR (SIR_M      and SIR_RM under the high-dimensional sparse settings).
